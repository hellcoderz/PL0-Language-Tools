# PL/0 Language Tools #

The PL/0 Language Tools serve as an example of how to construct a compiler. The language 'PL/0' was originally introduced in the book "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs", by Niklaus Wirth in 1975.

This project includes a full stack of tools designed for educational purposes to learn about compilers, interpreters and virtual machines. Each component can be executed independently and is typically between 100-300 lines of code.

It is designed to be clear and concise at the expense of performance. It is easy to extend and modify, e.g. adding new syntax constructs or machine instructions.
